    "text": "Boa noite, pessoal! Tô querendo começar nesse mundo da música de melhor qualidade, mas não manjo ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA da cena ainda! 😅\n\nAndei pesquisando alguns aparelhos mais baratos, mas tive dificuldade de encontrar comparativos entre eles. Desses aparelhos das imagens, qual vcs me recomendaram pra começar e ficar por um bom tempo (porque a grana não brota da torneira 🥲)? Queria um que pudesse usar também com streaming (Tidal ou Qobuz, ainda não decidi)...\n\nObrigado pela paciência e ajuda! 😊👍🏾",

For some reason, my Tidal app will crash multiple times throughout the day, it takes forever to load my \"Tracks\" and today, more than half of my saved tracks randomly disappeared from my library. I've tried deleting and redownload the app multiple times and signing in and out multiple times. There are plenty of things that I like about this platform, but these issues in particular have become a large disruption. Is there anything else I could try to resolve these issu",
