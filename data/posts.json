Mas sinto falta de recomendações boas quanto as que o Spotify fornecia.\n\nUso mais o app desktop Windows. Vou na aba \"descubra\", mas parece que na seção \"playlists Qobuz\" não aparecem recomendações que batem com o que gosto. Pra quem usa ele também, as recomendações que ele fornece são compatíveis com o seu gosto?\n\nTem algo que dá pra fazer pra melhorar? Ou estou usando do jeito errado?",

One of the most important features is the ability to import playlists directly from Spotify.\n\nThe Android app is currently in beta release. \n\nmore information on [Audion Website](http://audionplayer.com)",

Am going to sign up for the trial to give it a go, but was just wanting to get a sense of how widespread the problems are? I’m aware that people rarely go on a review site to say things are fine! \n\nAlso would be good to get people’s thoughts on whether the experience is generally improving or",

    "text": "I am new (today) to Qobuz. So far, I am mildly frustrated. The UI is definitely mistake prone. Trying to add songs to a playlist on the desktop app straight up did not work. I can do it on the mobile app, but it is tedious.\n\nIn the process, I’ve accidentally cloned every song in a 450-song playlist, making it 900 songs.\n\nIs there any non-manual way to undo this?\n\nI gotta say, this is so far extremely painful UI. Search is not great, controls are not sized right for mobile, and UX is lacking.\n\nLuckly \\*most\\* of my library came over. Missing a lot of local/regional stuff I like that is somehow ",

Don't see any options in the app apparently to do with this. \n\nI've got a Galaxy S23. All is up to date. \n\nAny thoughts?

Assinei o Qobuz e também ripei alguns CDs meus em FLAC, mas ainda não tenho um dispositivo que entregue toda essa qualidade como eu queria.\n\nQueria pegar algumas recomendações de vocês. Já dei uma olhada nas listas de recomendações da comunidade, mas queria opiniões além disso, de modelos que vocês realmente usaram e gostam. Andei pesquisando sobre o MXL HX9 e fiquei curioso — alguém aqui tem ou já usou? Como ele se sai na prática?\n\nBusco sugestões de dispositivos acessíveis, de entrada ou com bom ",

I have a Navidrome server running at the moment and a separate Qobuz subscription.\n\nI've always been conflicted on music services. On one hand, using Navidrome alone means no subscription to pay each month - but also no discovery. One the other, Qobuz means no hassle ripping, organising, managing, and maintaining my library and server.\n\nI started looking at Roon as a good all-in-one alternative.
