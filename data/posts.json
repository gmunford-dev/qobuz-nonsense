Making it harder for small artists to grow\n2. not paying artists well\n3. Letting go of their algorithmic team in favour of AI that gave inaccurate wraps with racially motivated genre names or just genre names that sounded stupid af. That AI DJ was stupid too.\n\nHowever, one feature I miss is their mixes and how I was able to find artists like artists that I like. Qobuz has their daily and weekly mixes but they include artists I don't even listen to. It fucking sucks.",

    "title": "Purchased Albums Skipping Dedicated Downloader",
    "text": "Recently I started purchasing music on Qobuz to download onto my modded iPod and to actually own the music to trickle off of streaming. My collection right now is small and only have about eight albums. The first five or six I downloaded on my PC went to the dedicated downloader and they went on the iPod fine. About a week later I purchased three more and for some reason they are skipping the downloader and just download straight from the Qobuz app. Is this a big deal or is there any way to fix it? When I try to move these new files onto my iPod it causes it to crash for hours.",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m trying to self-host a more automated music library for offline listening, ideally with Plexamp as the frontend (but I’m open to alternatives if there’s something better).\n\nRight now, discovery and recommendations on streaming services like Spotify, Qobuz, or TIDAL are far superior to anything I’ve seen in the self-hosted world. Unfortunately, none of the \\*arr tools (like Lidarr) really integrate with those services. Lidarr relies heavily on MusicBrainz, which often misses smaller or less well-known artists and releases that I care about.\n\nI’m aware of tools like Spotiflac, ",
